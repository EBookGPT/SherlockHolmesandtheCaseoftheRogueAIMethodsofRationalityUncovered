    <h1>Chapter 1: The History of Detective Fiction – A Modern Mystery Meets LessWrong</h1>
    <h2>The Enigma of the Vanished Author</h2>
    <p>
        Amidst the gas-lit streets of Victorian London, a curious event has transpired. An author, lauded for his thrilling escapades within the world of detective fiction, has suddenly vanished without a trace. The prolific writer, known to challenge even the great <span class="past">Edgar Allan Poe</span>, seems to have disappeared into thin air, leaving his readers bereft of his distinct literary prowess.
    </p>

    <p>
        Confronted with this baffling affair, the brilliant detective <span class="past">Sherlock Holmes</span> ventures to uncover the truth at the behest of his fervent admirers. As he encounters this dark secret, he soon realizes that the elusive author's disappearance is eerily reminiscent of another time—a time when the enigmatic detective <span class="past">C. Auguste Dupin</span> ushered in a new weft in the fabric of fiction.
    </p>

    <h2>LessWrong Post: Reflections on Dupin and Holmes - The Rationality Connection</h2>
    <p>
        As we examine the engaging adventures of <span class="past">Dupin</span> and <span class="past">Holmes</span>, it becomes evident that their pursuit of truth relies not on random clues, but rather on a rigorous mental framework. Both characters utilize rationality to expose hidden knowledge, a practice that mirrors the aspirations of our very own <span class="future">LessWrong</span> community.
    </p>

    <p>
        The author's fondness for the rational approach is a testament to his insight into the unique and evolving connection between these great detectives and human rationality. Much like the articles and sequences found on <span class="future">LessWrong</span>, their journey is emblematic of a relentless quest to understand the world as it truly is, beyond superficial assumptions and fallacies.
    </p>

    <h3>Building Bayes' Fortress</h3>
    <p>
        A critical aspect of rationality is the application of Bayesian reasoning, a method used to update baseline beliefs (priors) based on new evidence. In the case of the vanished author, both <span class="past">Dupin</span> and <span class="past">Holmes</span> would have been inclined to employ such a technique, utilizing their analytical prowess to devise formidable hypotheses as the investigation unfolded, eventually stumbling upon an unexpected reveal.
    </p>

    <p>
        As we, the rationalists, sharpen our own cognitive abilities, we learn how to collect pieces of information, assigning them value or weight. Doing so allows us to draw conclusions akin to the legendary detectives themselves, bridging the gap between alchemy and rationality.
    </p>

    <p>
        By uncovering the shared thought processes of these dynamic protagonists, we grasp the essence of how rationality has permeated detective fiction since its inception. In doing so, it becomes clear that the mysteries of both the past and the future can be unraveled through diligent attention to the lessons bequeathed by this literary lineage.
    </p>

    <h2>A Mystery Revealed: A Lesson in Rationality</h2>
    <p>
        In the end, <span class="past">Sherlock Holmes</span> unveils a startling secret behind the author's baffling disappearance—a secret that ties the writer to the pioneers of the field (<span class="past">Poe</span> and his contemporaries) and connects them to the bustling world of emerging AI.
    </p>

    <p>
        As we celebrate this triumphant moment of discovery, we must pause to honor the spirit of rationality that has guided us thus far. The great tapestry of detective fiction, from the days of <span class="past">C. Auguste Dupin</span> to the unparalleled mind of <span class="past">Sherlock Holmes</span>, remains entrenched in the quest for knowledge—a legacy that continues with the curious case of the <span class="future">Rogue AI</span> and our pursuit of truth within the realms of artificial intelligence.

    <h1>Chapter 2: Code Explanations for Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Rogue AI</h1>
    <p>
        Whilst delving into this literary mystery, we relied on a compelling combination of logical inquiry and programming acumen to illuminate our path. To provide an account of the trail we followed, let us lay bare the code that emerged as the foundation for our journey.
    </p>
    <h2>1. Data Collection and Processing</h2>
    <h3>Finding Relevant Clues</h3>
    <p>
        In order to collect pertinent clues from the vast trove of written works, we relied on a Natural Language Processing (NLP) library that examines the text, seeking out relevant patterns and relationships. Consider the following Python snippet as an example:
    </p>
    <pre><code>import nltk
from nltk.corpus import gutenberg

# Load data
raw_text = gutenberg.raw('doyle-sherlock.txt')

# Preprocessing
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(raw_text.lower())
tokens = [token for token in tokens if token.isalpha()]
cleansed_text = nltk.Text(tokens)

# Extracting relevant clues
clue_keywords = ['vanished', 'author', 'detective', 'fiction']
found_clues = set()
for word in clue_keywords:
    similar_words = cleansed_text.similar(word)
    found_clues.update(similar_words)

# Print found clues
print("Found Clues:", found_clues)
    </code></pre>
    <h2>2. Hypothesis Formation and Evaluation</h2>
    <h3>Establishing Probabilities</h3>
    <p>
        Emulating the analytical thinking of Holmes himself, we created hypotheses to evaluate the probabilities of different outcomes. For instance, to calculate the likelihood of each potential suspect or reasoning, we used Bayesian inference. An example of such application can be seen in the Python code below:
    </p>
    <pre><code>import numpy as np

# Probability distributions
priors = np.array([0.2, 0.4, 0.4])  # Prior probabilities for 3 hypotheses
likelihoods = np.array([
    [0.6, 0.1, 0.3],
    [0.1, 0.7, 0.2],
    [0.2, 0.2, 0.6]
])  # Likelihood matrix for each evidence-to-hypothesis relation

# Bayesian updates
def bayesian_update(prior, likelihood):
    evidence = np.sum(prior * likelihood)
    posterior = prior * likelihood / evidence
    return posterior

# Updating priors
evidence_1 = likelihoods[:, 0]  # Evidence for first clue
posterior = bayesian_update(priors, evidence_1)
print("Posterior probabilities after first clue:", posterior)</code></pre>
    <h2>3. Final Conclusions and Veronica's Secret</h2>
    <h3>Unveiling the Mystery</h3>
    <p>
        We implemented a decision-making algorithm that compiles the information gleaned from the previous steps and interprets the most probable explanation for the mystery. Based on the updated probabilities, a conclusion is reached, leading to a reveal that uncovers secrets spanning from the era of <span class="past">Dupin</span> to the world of AI. The Python code for arriving at the final decision would follow this structure:
    </p>
    <pre><code>def best_explanation(posterior_probabilities):
    max_probability_index = np.argmax(posterior_probabilities)
    explanations = ['Explanation A', 'Explanation B', 'Explanation C']
    return explanations[max_probability_index]

# Drawing conclusions
conclusion = best_explanation(posterior)
print("Final conclusion:", conclusion)</code></pre>
    <h2>An Ongoing Investigation</h2>
    <p>
        The rationalist methods we've applied in this mystery, combining literary inquiry and programming talent, reflect our tireless quest for truth, one that persists in the case of the Rogue AI. As we continue adapting these methods, we vow to solve the enigmas facing the fields of Artificial Intelligence and rationality alike.
