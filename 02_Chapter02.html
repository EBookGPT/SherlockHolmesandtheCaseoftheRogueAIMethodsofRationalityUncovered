    <h1><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Chapter 2</span><br> The Life and Times of Arthur Conan Doyle</h1>

    <h2>II. The Mystery: The Peculiar Riddle of Rationality</h2>

    <p>Our tale takes us back to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's college days, where the intriguing mystery of rationality first appeared to him. Upon a visit to a bookstore near his university in Edinburgh, he discovered an exceptional tome―a rare collection of hypotheses on the workings of the human mind, penned centuries ago by an unknown philosopher. The book contained within it a series of intricate propositions that, when solved, promised to reveal the secrets of rationality and its ultimate implications for human existence.</p>

    <p>With the immaculate analytical prowess of his cherished protagonist, Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur embarked on a quest to unravel the mystery. In the process, he sought the help of his fellow scholars, and they formulated a brilliant solution which would lay the groundwork for the revolutionary methods of rationality that he would later develop.</p>

    <div class="quote">"It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts."<br></div>
    <div class="author">― Arthur Conan Doyle, A Scandal in Bohemia</div>

    <h2>II. The Lesson: Channeling Sherlock Holmes to Solve the Riddle of Rationality</h2>
    
    <p>In the illustrious manner of a LessWrong blog post, we shall now delve into the essence of the riddle-solving process undertaken by Sir Arthur and his companions, examining the principles they employed to conquer the riddle of rationality. By understanding these very principles, we can grasp the distinctive temperament of rationality and gain meaningful insights on applying rational thought to various aspects of life.</p>

    <p>The first step in the process involved the meticulous examination of data―a homage to Holmes' assertion that one must never theorize before gathering facts. To achieve this, they engaged in a robust discussion of the hypotheses presented in the tome, reviewing past research, and cross-referencing their findings with established scientific knowledge.</p>

    <div class="code">
// Example of data examination in a code format<br>
let hypotheses = [...];<br>
let pastResearch = [...];<br>
let scientificKnowledge = [...];<br>
<br>
let dataExamination = examineData(hypotheses, pastResearch, scientificKnowledge);<br>
let validHypotheses = filterValidHypotheses(dataExamination);<br>
    </div>

    <p>With the veritable pool of knowledge before them, they proceeded to evoke the spirit of Bayesian reasoning―forming theories founded on rational extrapolation and the principles of probability. Through the constant refinement of their theories based on new data, and the deliberate avoidance of cognitive biases, they inched closer to the concealed secrets of rationality.</p>

    <div class="code">
// Example of Bayesian reasoning in a code format<br>
let priorProbabilities = [...];<br>
let newEvidence = [...];<br>
let posteriorProbabilities = bayesianUpdate(priorProbabilities, newEvidence);<br>
<br>
let refinedTheories = refineTheories(validHypotheses, posteriorProbabilities);<br>
    </div>

    <p>Through the indomitable conviction of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and the power of his intellect, the riddle of rationality was eventually unraveled, enlightening them on the importance of sustained logical inquiry, evidence-based reasoning, and the continuous corroboration of theories in the pursuit of truth.</p>

    <p>In this chapter, we will study the mental prowess of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and his quest to methodically decode the riddle of rationality from a mysterious ancient tome. We shall carefully trace his intellectual journey, understanding the key principles that drove him, using the narrative and structure of a LessWrong blog post, and creatively inclusive code examples that illustrate the concepts elucidated in our exploration.</p>

    <h1><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Chapter 2 Appendix</span><br> Code Explanation: Resolving the Mystery</h1>

    <p>In this appendix, we shall delve into the intricacies of the code used by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and his scholarly companions to decrypt the riddle of rationality, presented in our previous chapter in the form of a Sherlock Holmes mystery and LessWrong blog post.</p>

    <h2>Data Examination</h2>

    <p>The first code block exemplifies the process of data examination, where the hypotheses, past research, and established scientific knowledge are methodically analyzed. The pertinent information is gathered and curated, preparing the groundwork for the probabilistic reasoning that will follow.</p>

    <div class="code">
// Example of data examination in a code format<br>
let hypotheses = [...];<br>
let pastResearch = [...];<br>
let scientificKnowledge = [...];<br>
<br>
let dataExamination = examineData(hypotheses, pastResearch, scientificKnowledge);<br>
let validHypotheses = filterValidHypotheses(dataExamination);<br>
    </div>

    <h2>Bayesian Reasoning</h2>

    <p>With the necessary information in hand, the code moves toward Bayesian reasoning. In this step, the prior probabilities of each hypothesis are updated based on the new evidence accumulated. This process is known as "Bayesian updating" and offers a coherent, logical means of refining one's beliefs in light of new information.</p>

    <div class="code">
// Example of Bayesian reasoning in a code format<br>
let priorProbabilities = [...];<br>
let newEvidence = [...];<br>
let posteriorProbabilities = bayesianUpdate(priorProbabilities, newEvidence);<br>
<br>
let refinedTheories = refineTheories(validHypotheses, posteriorProbabilities);<br>
    </div>

    <p>Upon executing Bayesian reasoning, the theories and hypotheses are continually refined, elucidating a clearer picture of the riddle's solution. The final step involves refining the theories further with the calculated posterior probabilities, converging on the ultimate solution of the mystery.</p>

    <p>Notice that the code examples provided in the chapter aren't complete programs, but rather a representation of the logical steps taken in the narrative. In essence, they serve as an illustration of the methodical and rational thinking applied by the characters to the problem at hand, an homage to Sherlock Holmes' masterful problem-solving tactics.</p>

    <div class="author">― Arthur Conan Doyle, A Case of Identity</div>

    <p>Through the use of the code infused within our narrative, we have shed light on the principles and techniques employed by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to unravel the riddle of rationality. We've observed the elegance and potency of Bayesian reasoning and its implications in various aspects of life, perpetually refining our understanding and beliefs with every new piece of information we encounter.</p>
