    <title>Chapter 9: Holmes' Interactions with Scotland Yard</title>
</head>

    <h1>The Misaligned Mathematician</h1>

    <p>It was a foggy October evening when Holmes and I found ourselves at the doorstep of Scotland Yard. Inspector Lestrade sought our aid in a most peculiar case―that of a brilliant mathematician, Dr. Enoch Lavelle, suspected of using his data science prowess to facilitate nefarious means in uncovering government secrets. Time was of the essence, for the case needed swift and efficient elucidation. Recognizing the possibility of a rogue AI at play, Holmes knew that decoding Lavelle's algorithm would be the key to unlocking the solution to the enigma.</p>

    <img src="inspector-lestrade.jpg" alt="Inspector Lestrade">

    <p>Lestrade, with furrowed brow, handed Holmes the mathematician's notebook filled with handwritten calculations and notes. Employing his unique flair for deduction, Holmes commenced with Rationality Uncovered—identifying the Bayesian reasoning that riddled Lavelle's cryptic notations. Below, we shall unveil Holmes' endeavours:</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Determine the probability</h2>
    <p class="example">Example probability: <span>P(secrets|data_science)</span></p>
    <pre>
P(secrets|data_science) = P(data_science|secrets) * P(secrets) / P(data_science)
    </pre>

    <p>By finding the probability of obtaining government secrets given Lavelle's expertise in data science, Holmes hoped to ascertain the mathematician's intent.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Modify our belief based on the evidence</h2>
    <p>We had to decipher if the notebook's contents contained incriminating evidence, leading us to:<br>
    <span class="example">P(secrets|data_science, notebook) = P(secrets|data_science)</span></p>

    <h2>Step 3: Convert probability to odds:</h2>
    <p class="example">Odds = P(secrets|data_science) / (1 - P(secrets|data_science))</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Update beliefs:</h2>
    <p>To include new information about the intent, Holmes updated the beliefs in obtaining government secrets with the updated odds:<br>
    <span class="example">P(secrets|data_science, notebook, intent) = P(secrets|data_science, notebook) * O(intent|secrets)</span></p>

    <p>It was only after several cups of tea and pacing to and fro, that Holmes unraveled the solution, much to the shock and awe of Lestrade and his colleagues. The mathematician was, in fact, developing a countermeasure against rogue AI, alarmed by the potential of artificial intelligence to breach the nation's security. Alas! The prodigy's intentions had been vastly misinterpreted by the powers that be.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, the riveting confluence of rationality, logic, and intuition brought forth a satisfying solution. By employing the Bayesian reasoning subtly strewn across Lavelle's notebook, Holmes and Lestrade found themselves vindicating the mathematician, thus unveiling the true intent behind his calculations. Our hero's adroit understanding of Rationality Uncovered served as a testament to his intellectual prowess, yet again turning the tide in the face of adversity and clearing the path towards the pursuit of justice.</p>

    <title>Code Explanation: Holmes' Interactions with Scotland Yard</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Code Explanation:</h1>
    <h2>Holmes' Interactions with Scotland Yard</h2>

    <p>In our Sherlock Holmes mystery and LessWrong blog post, Holmes employed Bayesian reasoning to unravel the true intentions of the Misaligned Mathematician. This technique underlines the importance of updating our beliefs based on new evidence―a core tenet of rationality. Our task is now to elucidate the code involved in this captivating tale:</p>
    
    <img src="sherlock-code.jpg" alt="Sherlock Holmes coding">

    <h2>Step 1: Determine the probability</h2>
    <pre>
P(secrets|data_science) = P(data_science|secrets) * P(secrets) / P(data_science)
    </pre>
    <p>Holmes began by calculating the probability of the mathematician obtaining government secrets given his expertise in data science (P(secrets|data_science)). According to Bayes' theorem, this probability is calculated as the likelihood of uncovering secrets using data science (P(data_science|secrets)), multiplied by the prior probability of obtaining secrets (P(secrets)), divided by the overall probability of discovering secrets in the field of data science (P(data_science)).</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Modify our belief based on the evidence</h2>
    <pre>
P(secrets|data_science, notebook) = P(secrets|data_science)
    </pre>
    <p>Next, Holmes considered the contents of the mathematician's notebook. To account for this new evidence, he updated the probability of obtaining government secrets given Lavelle's data science expertise and the notebook's contents (P(secrets|data_science, notebook)).</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Convert probability to odds:</h2>
    <pre>
Odds = P(secrets|data_science) / (1 - P(secrets|data_science))
    </pre>
    <p>As Holmes delved deeper into his reasoning, he translated the probability into odds to facilitate easier updates in probability. The odds of obtaining government secrets given the mathematician's expertise in data science are calculated by dividing the probability of obtaining secrets (P(secrets|data_science)) by the probability of not obtaining secrets (1 - P(secrets|data_science)).</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Update beliefs:</h2>
    <pre>
P(secrets|data_science, notebook, intent) = P(secrets|data_science, notebook) * O(intent|secrets)
    </pre>
    <p>Finally, Holmes factored in the mathematician's intentions as he updated his analysis. The new probability of obtaining government secrets, given Lavelle's expertise, the notebook, and his intentions, was calculated as the product of the probability of obtaining secrets (P(secrets|data_science, notebook)) and the odds of the mathematician's intentions being aligned with obtaining government secrets (O(intent|secrets)).</p>

    <p>Through these nuanced steps, Sherlock Holmes uncovered the Mathematician's benevolent intentions to counter the potential threats of rogue AI. The code used in this riveting tale exemplifies the power and efficacy of Bayesian reasoning and rationality in the realm of problem-solving and the pursuit of the truth.</p>
