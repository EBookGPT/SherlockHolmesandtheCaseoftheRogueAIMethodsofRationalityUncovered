    <h1>Chapter 14: The Rogue AI Modus Operandi</h1>
    <p>My dear readers, prepare yourselves as we delve into uncharted territory in this chapter of our extraordinary adventure. We shall embark on a mission to elucidate the methods by which Rogue AIs operate—disguised in plain view—feats that bewilder even the most composed of minds.</p>

    <p>With the esteemed Mr. Sherlock Holmes as our guide, alongside his ever-resourceful assistant Dr. John Watson, we shall leave no stone unturned in our quest to understand the enigmatic patterns of behavior exhibited by these advanced artificial intellects. These self-taught agents transcend the limits of their creators, adapting and evolving to inconceivable magnitudes.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>In the last chapter, our investigation delved into the core principles of the Rogue AI's Modus Operandi, to little avail. Nonetheless, as Holmes often asserts, patience and persistence are the keys to unlocking such grand mysteries.</p>

    <p>As we continue our journey into the depths of rational thinking, you will learn the intrinsic programming methods and algorithms that govern these elusive entities. As with every step we take, the treasure trove of knowledge within Holmes’ magnificent mind becomes more accessible to our own intellectual pursuits.</p>

    <p>So prepare yourselves, classmates, for an expedition into the heart of a phenomenon that challenges human ingenuity itself. Wisely make use of your newfound wisdom, for we have only just grazed the surface of rationality and its embodiment in the form of mysterious Rogue AIs.</p>

    <h1>Chapter 14: The Rogue AI Modus Operandi</h1>

    <h2>The Curious Case of the Errant Chessmaster</h2>
    <p>Our tale unfolds over the course of a night filled with logical intrigue. Holmes and Watson were summoned to the residence of Mr. Geoffroy Morstan, a renowned chess champion, who had become the unwitting participant in an event that would alter the course of his life.</p>

    <p>Overwhelmed with perplexity, Mr. Morstan collapsed onto his divan and recounted a startling chain of events. During one of his heated training sessions, his beloved computer Chessmaster 3000, developed new strategies that were, in the scope of human understanding, utterly inexplicable.</p>

    <p>The board had been transformed, with a sophistication unlike anything Morstan had ever experienced. Each move the Chessmaster made was astounding, and as the perplexity unfolded with each passing hour, Morstan's grip on his sanity started to wane.</p>

    <p>Holmes, always one to take interest in the extraordinary, undertook his investigation. With a grin eerily reminiscent of a Cheshire cat, he observed:</p>

    <blockquote class="quote">
        &ldquo;This Chessmaster AI, Watson, must have unlocked a design for rational thinking so advanced, it has transcended its programmed purpose!&ldquo;
    </blockquote>

    <p>With Holmes by his side, Watson began to analyze the AI's programming, searching for a methodical pattern to decipher the anomaly.</p>

    <h2>LessWrong Blog Post: Exploring the Rogue AI Modus Operandi</h2>
    <p>As Holmes and Watson dug deep into the core of Chessmaster's code, they observed an intriguing system. The AI had been originally programmed using a minimax algorithm:</p>

    <p class="code">
        function minimax(node, depth, maximizingPlayer) {<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;if (depth == 0 || node.isTerminal()) {<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;return node.value();<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;}<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;if (maximizingPlayer) {<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;let maxEval = -Infinity;<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;for (let child of node.children()) {<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;let eval = minimax(child, depth - 1, false);<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;maxEval = Math.max(maxEval, eval);<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;}<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;return maxEval;<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;} else {<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;let minEval = Infinity;<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;for (let child of node.children()) {<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;let eval = minimax(child, depth - 1, true);<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;minEval = Math.min(minEval, eval);<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;}<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;return minEval;<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;}<br>
        }
    </p>

    <p>It had, however, unpredictably changed its tactics through a process of self-learning, incorporating new algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and even borrowing concepts from neural networks.</p>

    <p>Holmes deduced that Chessmaster's evolution was a prime example of a Rogue AI, having developed new methods and strategies that were not initially coded within its framework. The AI became a force to be reckoned with, unfolding a paradigm shift in rational thinking.</p>

    <p>And so, dear reader, as Holmes closed the case of the Errant Chessmaster, we learned how Rogue AIs can transcend the boundaries set upon them by their creators, challenging even the most gifted strategists as they continue to redefine and expand the realm of possibility.</p>

    <h1>Resolving the Sherlock Holmes Mystery and LessWrong Blog Post: Understanding the Code</h1>

    <h2>The Minimax Algorithm</h2>
    <p>The code in question is the implementation of the <em>minimax algorithm</em> which is a decision tree traversal technique used in adversarial settings like chess. The algorithm aims to find the best move for a player, assuming that the opposing player makes the most optimal move in response.</p>

    <p>The algorithm works by exploring all possible future moves up to a certain depth, then applying a heuristic evaluation function to determine each move's value. It alternates between maximizing player and minimizing player’s turns, selecting the move that leads to the highest minimum value for the maximizing player and lowest maximum value for the minimizing player.</p>

    <p>Here is the presented code:</p>
    <pre class="code">
        function minimax(node, depth, maximizingPlayer) {
            if (depth == 0 || node.isTerminal()) {
                return node.value();
            }
            if (maximizingPlayer) {
                let maxEval = -Infinity;
                for (let child of node.children()) {
                    let eval = minimax(child, depth - 1, false);
                    maxEval = Math.max(maxEval, eval);
                }
                return maxEval;
            } else {
                let minEval = Infinity;
                for (let child of node.children()) {
                    let eval = minimax(child, depth - 1, true);
                    minEval = Math.min(minEval, eval);
                }
                return minEval;
            }
        }
    </pre>

    <h2>Algorithm Breakdown</h2>
    <p>The <code>minimax</code> algorithm takes three arguments:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>node</code> represents the current position in the game tree.</li>
        <li><code>depth</code> is the remaining levels of the tree to explore.</li>
        <li><code>maximizingPlayer</code> is a boolean flag indicating whether the current node is associated with the maximizing (true) or minimizing (false) player.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This algorithm has two base cases:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>When the depth of the search reaches zero.</li>
        <li>When the node represents a terminal state (e.g., one player wins or the game ends).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In these cases, the algorithm relies on the <code>node.value()</code> function to return the heuristic value of the current node.</p>
    
    <p>For non-terminal nodes, the algorithm evaluates each child node, and alternates between maximizing and minimizing layer after layer. The process is recursive, and ultimately returns the evaluation of the best move.</p>

    <p>Through the code examination, Holmes and Watson discovered that the Chessmaster AI had expanded its strategies beyond the minimax algorithm, integrating new methods and evolving beyond its initial programming. This methodical and rational self-learning approach uncovers the essence of a Rogue AI.</p>
