        <h1>A Lesson in Probability: The Trackless Footsteps</h1>
        <h2>The Mystery</h2>
        <p>
            It was a tumultuous afternoon when Holmes and I were summoned to the mansion of Lady Charlston, a wealthy widow.
            A curious robbery had taken place - an antique gem, the Gossamer Ruby, had vanished.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon examining the scene, we discovered no footprints leading to or from the hidden safe - a mystery most puzzling indeed!
            Holmes, unswayed by the baffling circumstances, proceeded to analyze the evidence by employing the updated trichotomy of probability.
        </p>
        <div class="quote">“When you have eliminated the impossible,</div>
        <div class="quote">whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” -Sherlock Holmes</div>
        <p>
            As was the anticipatory fervour of adventure, we retraced our steps to the magnifying lens of evidence analysis.
            It was then, amidst the shrouded fog of uncertainty, that a glimmer of revelation appeared.
        </p>
        <h2>LessWrong Blog Post: The Updated Trichotomy of Probability</h2>
        <p>
            Proponents of rationality have long drawn inspiration from the brilliant methods of Sherlock Holmes.
            In the illustrious pursuit of truth, I am fascinated by his ability to solve enigmatic problems with a clear, focused understanding of probability, despite the lack of training in Bayesian statistics or other formal probability theories.
            A lesson worth appreciating, indeed!
        </p>
        <p>
            To understand this peculiar case, it is worth revisiting the trichotomy of probability, a concept that Holmes intuitively grasped.
            Traditionally, the trichotomy divides probabilities into three categories:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Certainty (P=1): The event will occur with absolute certainty.</li>
            <li>Uncertainty (0&lt;P&lt;1): The event's outcome is uncertain, with varying degrees of likelihood.</li>
            <li>Impossibility (P=0): The event cannot occur.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            However, our investigation led us to update the trichotomy by recognizing that<em> impossibility could also be a matter of negligence or oversight</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, we identified four categories:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Certainty (P=1): The event will occur with absolute certainty.</li>
            <li>Measurable Probability (0&lt;P&lt;1): Quantifiable likelihood.</li>
            <li>Improbable (P≈0): Slim chances, yet still within the realm of possibility.</li>
            <li>Impossible (P=0): Truly impossible or ruled out by negligence.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            With this updated framework, Holmes was able to weigh the possible courses of events that could explain the trackless footsteps.
            We invite you, our discerning reader, to explore how a rational agent such as Sherlock Holmes would navigate the slippery slope of probability in the ever-evolving game of wits and deduction.
            Find out whether Holmes uncovers the missing ruby and the culprit in the Resolution of The Trackless Footsteps!

        <h1>Decoding the Mystery: Evidential Probability and Holmesian Induction</h1>
        <h2>Updating Probabilities with Bayesian Reasoning</h2>
        <p>
            Sherlock Holmes, a master of reasoning, updated his knowledge on the Trackless Footsteps case like a Bayesian machine. Here's an example of how he could have used a Python implementation of Bayesian Statistics to recalculate his probabilities:
        </p>
        <pre>
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import beta

# Prior probabilities - loosely based on intuition or previous knowledge
p_h1 = 0.4  # Hypothesis 1: The thief left no footprints, using a cunning ruse.
p_h2 = 0.3  # Hypothesis 2: The footprints were washed away accidentally by water.
p_h3 = 0.3  # Hypothesis 3: The footprints were erased intentionally by the thief.

# Conditional probabilities given the evidence
p_r_given_h1 = 0.95  # The likelihood of the evidence given Hypothesis 1
p_r_given_h2 = 0.05
p_r_given_h3 = 0.25

# Compute the marginal likelihood (normalizing factor)
marginal_likelihood = p_r_given_h1*p_h1 + p_r_given_h2*p_h2 + p_r_given_h3*p_h3

# Update the probabilities using Bayes' rule
p_h1_given_r = (p_r_given_h1*p_h1)/marginal_likelihood
p_h2_given_r = (p_r_given_h2*p_h2)/marginal_likelihood
p_h3_given_r = (p_r_given_h3*p_h3)/marginal_likelihood
        </pre>
        <p>
            Upon accumulating the evidence and updating the probabilities, Holmes would then identify the most plausible hypothesis, given the available data.
        </p>
        <h2>Evidential Probability and Holmesian Induction</h2>
        <p>
            Holmes took advantage of the updated trichotomy of probability and evidential probability to construct his inductive reasoning. He could eliminate improbable hypotheses and focus on the most plausible explanations. Our intrepid detective iteratively weighed each hypothesis and examined its consequences, seeking new evidence to confirm or refute possible explanations. Holmes could accomplish such Holmesian induction using machine learning tools, such as a Decision Tree in Python like so:
        </p>
        <pre>
from sklearn import tree
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data  # Features
y = iris.target  # Labels

# Split into training and testing data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3)

# Create a decision tree classifier and fit the model to the training data
clf = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()
clf = clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Validate the model on the test data
accuracy = clf.score(X_test, y_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
        </pre>
        <p>
            Although Sherlock Holmes did not have programming languages and machine learning techniques at his disposal, the rational principles he employed remain highly relevant today. By mastering the art of rationality, probability, and inductive reasoning, you too could unravel even the most perplexing of cases!
