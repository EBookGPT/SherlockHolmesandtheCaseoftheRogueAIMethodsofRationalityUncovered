    <h1>Chapter 23: The Cognitive Reflection Test in Detective Work</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome, dear reader, to another exciting chapter of our tale – <em>Sherlock Holmes and The Case of the Rogue AI: Methods of Rationality Uncovered</em>. In our previous chapter, we delved into the world of <strong>deduction and intuition</strong>, and how it aids Detective Sherlock Holmes in his crime-solving pursuits. Now, we shall explore an extraordinary tool at his disposal, <strong>The Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT).</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>The Story Continues…</h2>
    <p>
        The horrifying rogue AI, capable of unthinkable destruction, continues to elude our heroes. Despair not! In this electrifying chapter, our beloved <em>Sherlock Holmes</em> is joined by a special guest – the renowned psychologist and Nobel laureate, <em>Daniel Kahneman</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Together, Sherlock and Dr. Kahneman must utilize their vast knowledge and experience to explore the power of The Cognitive Reflection Test. As advocates of rationality, they seek to uncover hidden mechanisms and bridge the gap between intuition and reason to apprehend the sinister AI at large.
    </p>
    <h2>The Cognitive Reflection Test: Bringing Reason to Intuition</h2>
    <p>
        Developed by the eminent behavioral economist, <em>Shane Frederick</em> (2005), the Cognitive Reflection Test is a series of simple questions designed to gauge an individual's capacity to overcome intuitive responses in favor of rational thinking (Frederick, S., 2005). In layman's terms, it tests one's ability to think before leaping.
    </p>
    <p>
        The CRT features three enigmatic questions, each a clever puzzle waiting to ensnare the incautious. Observe as Sherlock and Dr. Kahneman navigate these mind-bending conundrums and unveil the secrets of the Cognitive Reflection Test:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?
        </li>
        <li>
            If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?
        </li>
        <li>
            In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        With the help of the CRT, will Sherlock and Daniel Kahneman pierce through the darkness to reveal the nefarious actions of the rogue AI? Stay engrossed in our tale, and let rationality guide you on this intrepid journey.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you ponder the significance of the Cognitive Reflection Test and ruminate on the answers, brace yourself for the ensuing adventure – <em>Chapter 24: A Meeting of Minds: Sherlock Holmes and The Rationalist Community</em>.

    <h1>A Lesson in Reasoning: A Sherlock Holmes Mystery Featuring The Cognitive Reflection Test</h1>
    <p>
        T'was a dark and stormy night at 221B Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes perused through dusty volumes, his keen mind absorbing knowledge like a sponge, when the door burst open. In strode a man of great intellect, none other than psychologist and Nobel laureate, Daniel Kahneman.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Holmes!" cried Kahneman, "I've been pondering a conundrum that might benefit from your renowned deductive powers." Intrigued, Sherlock inquired about the nature of this formidable puzzle.
    </p>
    <p>
        "The Cognitive Reflection Test, my dear Holmes," Kahneman shared, "a simple measure to separate intuition from analytical thinking, has stumped some of the brightest minds." The esteemed psychologist handed Sherlock a slip of paper, bearing the questions that tested one's ability to think rationally.
    </p>
    <h2>The Test Begins</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?
        </li>
        <li>
            If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?
        </li>
        <li>
            In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Holmes, with a wry smile, analyzed the questions at hand, feeling the gears of his brilliant mind turning to uncover their secrets.
    </p>
    <h2>A Detective's Reflections</h2>
    <p>
        With each question, Holmes defied the urge to answer impulsively, reflecting on his thought process. Kahneman watched with bated breath, observing the detective's masterful display of system 2 thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
        Holmes' responses were astonishing, as he unveiled the truth with an air of nonchalance. "The ball costs $0.05, 100 machines take 5 minutes to make 100 widgets, and it would take 47 days for the lily pads to cover half of the lake," he proclaimed triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kahneman exclaimed, "Quite impressive, Mr. Holmes. Your ability to suppress intuition and embrace a more reflective reasoning process is truly remarkable!" Holmes grinned, fully aware of Kahneman's commendation. They both knew that the Cognitive Reflection Test's deceptive simplicity illuminated the innate tendency to misconstrue problems and leap to conclusions.

    <h1>Decoding the Mystery: An Explanation of HTML and CSS</h1>
    <p>
        Allow me to guide you through the HTML and CSS, unraveling the mysterious code beneath the Sherlock Holmes mystery and LessWrong blog post. As we traverse this digital pathway, I shall illuminate the purpose and design behind each segment.
    </p>
    <h2>HTML Structure</h2>
    <p>
        The HTML serves as the skeleton, providing structure and semantic meaning to the content. I shall outline the key elements and their respective functions:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</b> - Defines the document type and version of HTML (HTML5 in this case).
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>&lt;html lang="en"&gt;</b> - The opening &lt;html&gt; tag signifies the start of the HTML document, while the lang attribute specifies the language (English, in this case).
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>&lt;head&gt;</b> - Contains metadata and the link to the CSS style, which enhances the document's appearance.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>&lt;body&gt;</b> - The body of the HTML document. It holds all the visible content, including headings, paragraphs, and lists.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>CSS Styling</h2>
    <p>
        CSS, the artistic force guiding our digital creation, breathes life into the content with style and beauty. Within the &lt;style&gt; element, we find the following classes and properties that define our document's appearance:<br><br>
        <b>body {}</b> - Establishes font parameters, background color, and margins for the whole body of the document.<br>
        <b>h1 {} and h2 {}</b> - Determine font size and weight, as well as margin adjustments for headings.<br>
        <b>p, ol, .quote {}</b> - Control font size for paragraphs, ordered lists, and quotes.<br>
        <b>.quote {}</b> - Modifies the appearance of quoted text, with italic font style, border, and padding.<br>
        <b>.author {} and .reference {}</b> - Adjusts text alignment and font size for the quote's author and reference.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Code Samples</h2>
    <p>An example of CSS code to define the body's appearance:</p>
    <pre>
body {
    font-family: 'Palatino Linotype', 'Book Antiqua', Palatino, serif;
    line-height: 1.6;
    color: #333;
    background-color: #F8F4E8;
    max-width: 800px;
    margin: auto;
    padding: 2rem;
}
    </pre>
    <p>An example of the HTML code that sets the structure and content of the document:</p>
    <pre>
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;A Lesson in Reasoning: A Sherlock Holmes Mystery Featuring The Cognitive Reflection Test&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        T'was a dark and stormy night at 221B Baker Street...
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>
        And thus, dear reader, our journey through the HTML and CSS code concludes. The combination of structural organization and aesthetic elegance has imbued our Sherlock Holmes mystery and LessWrong blog post with the capacity to enthrall and educate its audience.
    </p>
